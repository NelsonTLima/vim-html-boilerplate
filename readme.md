# HOW TO USE

Whenever you are in a empty html file, you can generate the boilerplate text just calling
the HtmlBoilerplate() function in your VIM with:

```vim
:call HtmlBoilerplate()
```

You can also set a custom shortcut adding the following line to your .vimrc
In the following example we will show how to make "!" as our shortcut just like
Visual Studio Code does:

```vim
map ! :call HtmlBoilerplate()<CR>
```

Now our boilerplate will apear every time you press "!" in a html empty file.
